The Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database (NNDb v1.0) contains datasets from 86 human participants doing the NIH Toolbox and then watching one of 10 full-length movies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
The participants were all right-handed, native English speakers, with no history of neurological/psychiatric illnesses, with no hearing impairments, unimpaired or corrected vision and taking no medication.
Each movie was stopped in 40-50 minute intervals or when participants asked for a break, resulting in 2-6 runs of BOLD-fMRI.
A 10 minute high-resolution defaced T1-weighted anatomical MRI scan (MPRAGE) is also provided.

The NIH Toolbox data is:
- nih_demographics.csv
- nih_data.csv
- nih_scores.csv

Some inital stimulus annotations can be found in the stimuli folder

Data is organized as follows:
- The sub-<ID> folders contain raw data for fMRI runs and anatomical scans. 
- The derivatives sub-<ID> folders contain the:
- Fully preprocessed fMRI data
- Motion and ICA artifact files
- Anatomical mask with white matter and ventricles removed 
- An anatomical image aligned
- All files are aligned to N27 MNI template
- The mriqc derivatives folder contain the MRIQC no-reference image quality metrics for the NNDb anatomical and functional data

NOTES:
* Subjects 3-6, 10, 11, 24, 28, 29, 31, 39, 41, 72, 83-85 did not have the original IMA files to format into BIDS, so they were manually created (functionals) or copied in from other subjects (anatomicals). These will be updated once access to UCL facilities is restored after the COVID-19 lockdown.
* If you plan to use the raw data with the stimuli / annotations, please be aware that some temporal interpolation is necessary. See our manuscript for details and GitHub for an example script to do this. Or just email one of us.
